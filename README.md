## What kind of project is this?
This is a site with simulated registration, authorization, and the ability to place an entry on the main page (the owner has the ability to edit or delete the entry).

## What technologies have I used?
- Python (Django)
- HTML & CSS
- sqlite3
- Bootstrap

## Why did I even start creating this project?
I started this project to study working with frameworks in the python programming language. The experience of working with it is much different from my previous experience of creating a website without frameworks in the golang language. It was also the first time I worked with **bootstrap** to quickly design styles on pages.
